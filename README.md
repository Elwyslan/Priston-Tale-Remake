# Priston Tale Remake

**Aim**:  
Remake of Priston Tale, but in a better way with friendly code and open source.  
Priston Tale had a great potential, but bad game design choices (and software design) hindered the growth of the game and thrown it into oblivion.  
I do not promise to do it all. But I'll try my best.  
With baby steps, let's see how far I can go.  
I'm going to use C++17 because of reasons (because I want to learn it).  
Let's going into it.
